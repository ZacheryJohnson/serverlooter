tutorial_ask_start = Last login: 782 days. Restart tutorial?
tutorial_stage_1 = Welcome back. This is the Server Management Hub.
tutorial_stage_2 = On the left, you'll see the servers you own. Open the drop down and select the only server you own.
tutorial_stage_3 = Here you'll see your server's stats. Far from a industry-standard machine, but it'll do.
tutorial_stage_4 =
    Let's create a script that will run on this server to start "earning" some credits.
    Click on Scripts tab in the Develop menu.
tutorial_stage_5 =
    This is where the tutorial will teach you to create scripts once Zach implements it.
    For now, just click Next.
tutorial_stage_6 =
    Nice script! Unfortunately, we have no idea what servers are out there for us to... "capitalize" on.
    Let's see if any one is selling any on the market. Click the Market tab.
tutorial_stage_7 =
    Look, someone's selling a cheat data dump on exposed corpo servers.
    Let's buy that and see what we can find. For now, click Next to simulate buying the data dump.
tutorial_stage_8 =
    Now that we know what servers are out there, let's go make some creds.
    Click the Exploit tab in the Black Hat menu.
tutorial_stage_9 =
    Here are the servers whose connection details we just purchased.
    Each server contains different resources we can acquire and different defenses that we must overcome.
    Our script is best at *Extract*ing credits, so let's target the first server.
tutorial_stage_10 =
    Ah, the sweet acrid scent of credits hitting your wallet. Nice work.
    Shall we see what CorpB has to offer?
tutorial_stage_11 =
    Well, that went less than ideal. Seems like their defenses are better suited for our script.
    Let's head to the Market to see if anyone is selling any algorithms that would improve our odds.
tutorial_stage_12 =
    Here is where you can buy and sell algorithms that have been stolen from corps.
    Let's buy a Packet Spoofing algorithm, then click on the Scripts tab to add it.
tutorial_stage_13 =
    When including multiple algorithms in a script, you can choose how to execute them.
    There's lot of neat ways to arrange algorithms that you can discover!
    For now, let's execute our Spoofer in parallel with our Extractor.
